Using ML for Disaster Relief Prediction of Locations of Human Aid Needs in Haiti from Photo Image Data 

## Preface

o	Need to scour millions of photos to identify blue tarps in order to provide relief.(humanitarian crisis/aid)
o	Images quantified using RGB , and clusters for Blue Tarps were built comparing QDA, LDA, SVM, Logistic, and other models
o	Accuracy in final model was X%, allowing for greater predictionâ€¦.


## Introduction
It was 2012. I was floating on a raft in the crystal clear Haitian waters with the sun warming my face, and coconut and fruit on my tongue. Peering though my Ralph Lauren sunglasses, I catch sight of a deflated plastic juice-bag-shaped object floating by. I could make out the word 'water'. In that moment I was hit with the bleak reminder of the devastation that occurred just on the other side of the beautiful mountain tops in 2010. The earthquake that left families and children hungry, longing for food and shelter and suffering the loss of loved ones. These water sachets or 'saches dlo' are commonly distributed throughout Haiti in times of disaster and times of peace, providing potable water to those who call Haiti their home.

How was aid distributed to the 300,000 people that were injured in the earthquake and 5 million* displaced?  Analysis of the disaster relief data reveals the power of data mining in helping provide actionable insights for social aid for incomprehensible conditions.
